#### Training project for the code bootcamp 'The Hacking Project'

## Project not finished yet, but the tree works.

### What I did so far :
- The treeMorpions.js is functional, you can run it and check how it finds all play options round by round.

### Need to be done :
- Because I am too short in time, the HTML tic-tac-toe project is not finalized. The treeMorpions.js file is the base for a future IA.
- IA needs to be finished (= 2.3.3 of the project), I am gonna use this method : https://alialaa.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-js-minimax
