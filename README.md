# Project not finished yet, but the tree works.

## What I did so far :
- The treeMorpions.js is functional, you can run it and check how it finds the game options round after round.

## Need to be done :
- Because I am too short in time, the HTML tic-tac-toe project is not finalized. The treeMorpions.js file is the base for the future IA.
- IA needs to be finished (= 2.3.3 of the project), I am gonna use this : https://alialaa.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-js-minimax
